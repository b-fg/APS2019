## APS Division Fluid Dynamics 2019 Meeting, Seattle (US)

APS DFD 2019 Meeting slides for my talk: "Deep learning the spanwise-averaged turbulent wake of a circular cylinder".

The presentation has been created with Inkscape using the JessyInk extension which organises slides by layers (.svg format). Open the "APS2019.svg" with any web browser to play the presentation.

The movie files "tgv.mov" and "uv.mp4" need to be in the same directory as the presentation to be played (click) on slides 7 (top right corner sketch) and 10 (main figure) respectively.

This presentation uses the "CMU Serif" font, so if it is not installed in your local computer you can play the "APS2019_objects-to-path.svg" file instead, where all text objects have been converted to vector paths. Otherwise, the original "APS2019.svg" will be played with the backup default font used by your web browser.
